# gobrewcleanup
Practice Golang by cleaning up brew packages. A bit overkill, but it's sharpening the axe.

# Idea

Get all packages installed by `brew`. Ask about all the manually installed packages if they're still needed or can be removed. Create a list to be removed.

Imagine something like

```
[+] Found 138 manually installed packages

(r)eview (l)ist (e)xport
> r

Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3_7... (28 files, 1.9MB)
```

Essentially a `for each package in $(brew leaves); do prompt && brew remove $package; done`
